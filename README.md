# Proj1-CMPM121

My scene is of a street where a car is in the street with both animals and the enviroment is 
in the scenery. For example there is a chicken and some trees along wiht muchrooms.
Some objects I decided to add into my scene are some obstacles for the car to possibly dodge
in the future. Along with that I also decided to add some mountains and trees to make it more 
realistic, and a skybox of the sky to add to the realism. One thing that really inspired me
when starting this project was the fact that I really enjoy car rides and I felt like this would
be cool to simulate in unity. The main character of this scene is the car GameObject which I
renamed to main character.
